I completed a Masters in Quantum Information Science through the Institute for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo in 2020. After a brief stint as a quantum software engineer, I am now pursuing a PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia. This has meant switching from the computer and information science subfield, which saw my first thesis, paper and three patents between 2018 and 2020, to the new subfield of quantum devices in which I have also published recently in 2024. I have founded two profitable companies in the past, both in tech, building our products myself as a full stack software and hardware engineer. I also enjoy writing hard sci-fi. In my spare time, I love hiking, camping and spending time with my wife and dog.

  Quantum programming languages, like Q#, OpenQASM, QMASM and BlackBird! I am maintaining a web-first compile toolchain for these langauges here and on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/~marcusedwards). I am also implementing an open source OpenQASM 3.0 interpreter @XanaduAI.

  Quantum computing hardware, like my PCB carrier for quantum processors and more.
